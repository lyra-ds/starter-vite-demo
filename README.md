# Lyra DS Vite template — live demo

**▶ [lyra-ds.github.io/starter-vite-demo](https://lyra-ds.github.io/starter-vite-demo/)**

This repository is the deployed demo of the
[Lyra DS Vite template](https://github.com/lyra-ds/starter-vite): a minimal
[Vite](https://vite.dev) + React setup for
[Lyra Design System](https://lyra-ds.dev). It ships the public Lyra styles
and React packages, local fonts, theme selection (light / dark / system),
live white-label branding, and ready-to-go lint, test, and CI setup.

Because it is the demo, it keeps the starter home component and the two
example brands instead of replacing them.

## Create your project

Click **Use this template** on GitHub, or:

```sh
npx tiged lyra-ds/starter-vite my-app
```

`create-vite` only scaffolds its own built-in templates, so community
templates like this one are cloned with [tiged](https://github.com/tiged/tiged)
— it's what the [Vite guide](https://vite.dev/guide/#community-templates)
recommends. Plain cloning works too. Then:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

`npm` and `yarn` work as well.

## After cloning

- [ ] Rename `name` in `package.json`.
- [ ] Edit the `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` in `index.html`.
- [ ] Replace the example brands in `src/brand.css` with your own.
- [ ] Swap `public/favicon.svg` for your favicon.
- [ ] When you start building, delete `src/components/starter-home.tsx` (and
      its test) and replace `src/App.tsx`.

> In this demo repo the last three items are intentionally left undone — the
> starter home, the favicon, and the example brands _are_ what the demo shows.

## Deploy

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds on every push to `main` and publishes
`dist/` to GitHub Pages (Pages source: **GitHub Actions**). A project page is
served from a sub-path, so `vite.config.ts` sets
`base: '/starter-vite-demo/'` — change it to your own repo name, or drop it
if you deploy to a user/organization page or a custom domain. Reference
files from `public/` with `` `${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}file.svg` `` so they
resolve under that base.

## White-label branding

Lyra rebrands with only four CSS variables — everything else derives from
them:

```css
[data-brand='acme'] {
  --brand: #176b87;
  --brand-contrast: #ffffff;
  --brand-radius: 0.75rem;
  --brand-font: 'Plus Jakarta Sans', sans-serif;
}
```

See `src/brand.css` for the two example brands the demo switches between.
The demo's "Lyra" option is the baseline look: it removes `data-brand`
entirely — never set the attribute without defining `--brand`, or the
derived accent group resolves to nothing.

## Scripts

| Script              | What it does                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`          | Start the dev server          |
| `pnpm build`        | Type-check + production build |
| `pnpm preview`      | Preview the production build  |
| `pnpm test`         | Run tests (Vitest + jsdom)    |
| `pnpm lint`         | ESLint (typescript-eslint)    |
| `pnpm format`       | Prettier write                |
| `pnpm format:check` | Prettier check (used in CI)   |

CI runs lint, format check, tests, and build on every push and PR.

## AI agents

The template ships an [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) that points AI coding
agents at the Lyra DS docs, the machine-readable component contracts
([llms.txt](https://lyra-ds.dev/llms.txt)), and this project's commands and
conventions. Keep it updated as your project evolves.
